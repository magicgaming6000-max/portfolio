					<h3>Eagle Scout</h3>
					<p>
						Becoming an Eagle Scout took seven years of commitment, growth, and showing up even when it was hard.
						I earned Eagle alongside my friend Elijah Jay (pictured), and that journey gave me a real love for the outdoors,
						practical life skills, and the confidence to lead. Through leadership roles in my troop, I learned how to plan,
						teach, and take responsibility for the people around me.

				<div class="highlight-text">
					<h3>Line Cook Experience</h3>
					<p>
						I genuinely enjoy working in a fast-paced kitchen. I cook on the line, prep for banquets, and help with catering—
						so every shift is a mix of speed, precision, and teamwork. Kitchen work has taught me how to stay calm under pressure,
						communicate clearly, and take pride in doing the small things right.

					<h3>First Marathon</h3>
					<p>
						I ran my first marathon with my dad, who’s an experienced runner and has completed nine marathons.
						I trained for four months and had to work through setbacks, fatigue, and the mental challenge of staying consistent.
						Crossing the finish line with my dad is one of my proudest moments—it reminded me that discipline and support
						can carry you further than motivation alone. Now I’m planning to run another marathon, and this time I’ve convinced
						a few of my friends (who have never done one) to train and do it with me.

					<h3>Student Ministry Team</h3>
						<p>
							I’ve been part of my Catholic church my whole life, and now that I’m in college I joined the Student Ministry Team (SMT).
							We plan events that bring the college community together, build faith, and create real friendships.
							We also help organize retreats and service trips—basically, we’re trying to make it easier for students to feel known,
							connected, and keep their faith alive in college.
